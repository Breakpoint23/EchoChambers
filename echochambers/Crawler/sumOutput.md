To resolve the CSRF Verification failed error in a Django app, you can follow these steps:

1. Add the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag as a child of the `form` element in your Django template to include the CSRF token in the form submission.
2. Check the `CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN` setting and set it to `None` on the development environment if needed.
3. Set up `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in Django 4.0 to prevent malicious users from using incorrect tokens.
4. Ensure that the middleware classes in your Django settings are properly configured for CSRF protection.
5. If you don't want to use the CSRF token, you can disable it from the settings file of the main app.
6. Adjust the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` setting to include relevant domains for CSRF protection.
7. Verify that `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `CSRF_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `CORS_ORIGINS_WHITELIST`, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are properly configured in your settings.
8. Make sure the CsrfViewMiddleware is properly configured to add the CSRF cookie to the response.
9. Follow the correct sequence of making a GET request before a POST request to receive the CSRF cookie.
10. Understand the specific requirements of your framework and authentication method for CSRF validation.
